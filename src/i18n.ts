    evol_gen_a_r3_1_detail: "Can use normal attacks while carrying the flag. Flag attacks restore 4 HP and reduce attack cost to 6 energy.",
    evol_gen_a_r3_2_detail: "Each attack also moves the General in the attack direction and knocks the enemy back. Enemies can be knocked back up to 2 tiles; if an enemy hits a wall, the General stops one tile in front, so the General can advance up to 3 tiles.",
    evol_gen_b_r1_detail: "Units behind the flag (your half of the map) naturally recover 1 HP each turn.",
    evol_gen_b_r2_detail: "Allies in a 5x5 area around the flag gain a 25% damage-reduction barrier.",

    evol_rng_b_r1_detail: "Ranger pickup range increases to Manhattan distance 2.",
    evol_rng_b_r2_detail: "Ranger gains a stealth action: spend 3 energy per tile to move while fully hidden. Enemies cannot see Ranger movement unless a mine is triggered.",
    evol_rng_b_r3_1_detail: "Remove the active stealth skill. Ranger's default movement becomes stealth, with movement cost reduced to 2 energy.",
    evol_rng_b_r3_2_detail: "Ranger gains a new action to throw a carried mine within Manhattan distance 2. It detonates immediately on landing; if it hits an enemy, it deals 50% damage. Costs 5 energy.",

    evol_mkr_a_r3_2_detail: "Maker gains Ultimate Mine (12 damage). It triggers when an enemy enters the surrounding 3x3, detonates a 3x3 blast (allies take half damage), and destroys enemy mines and buildings in the blast area. Costs 9 energy.",
    evol_mkr_b_r1_detail: "Unlock [Autonomous Workshop]. Mine cap becomes 5+1, and the extra 1 mine must be placed in the workshop's surrounding 3x3 area (outside workshop range remains capped at 5). Costs 6 energy. Enemies can stand on it and spend 2 energy to dismantle it.",
    evol_mkr_b_r2_detail: "Workshop now supports special mine types and its range changes to Manhattan distance 2. Mine cap becomes 5+2, and the extra 2 mines must be placed within workshop range.",
